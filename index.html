            <p style="color: black;" id="content">A developer is an individual who is responsible for creating or working on the development of a product or service. Most developers utilize one or more programming languages to develop their product or service. They may work alone or on a team, and may develop part of or all a product or service. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle employ many developers, due to the complexity of the products and services they develop and sell to customers.For example, a software developer is an individual that may create a new software program or maintain an existing software program. A web developer is an individual that creates or updates web pages, utilizing HTML, JavaScript, or other web programming languages.Anyone interested in developing software, such as a program, game, or online service, must start by learning a programming language. There are many programming languages and creating a new software program requires more training and more time than one page can provide. Therefore, this page is meant as a general overview to help point you in the direction to get started. An important beginning step is to have a plan for what program you want to develop. For instance, a plan would include the purpose of the program, game, or service, and the features you want to include. Be thinking of what your plan is as you continue reading.As we noted above, there are many different programming languages. Deciding which language to learn can be a challenge by itself. Creating a program with many features and functions often requires you to be fairly proficient in one or more programming languages.That being said, basic understanding of the concepts of pretty much any programming language can help to get you started. Our listing of programming languages includes examples of the various types of software each language can create. Here are a few of our recommendations.</p>
